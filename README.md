## Dark History

At my previous job interview, I took the psychological test by pen for 4 hours, including a 
launch break. So I came up with an idea: __Why the hell can't you guys use a computer
instead ? Are you retarded or what ?__ So I wrote a psychological test app in PHP and showed 
it to the HR. 
And the HR said I have to get permission from the HR director, 
And HR director said he would send a tech guy to me later on, 
And...... that 'Ghost Tech Guy' never showed up!
And that's why you are seeing this on Github.

The last version of psycho-cat was based on XAMPP, but since __PHP is the best language in the world!__,
I decided to replace it with NodeJS + SQLite. I will try to make the installation as simple as XAMPP, though.

## Features

1. __Do NOT need__ a internet connection 
2. Edit your questions/answers/scores by Excel, psycho-cat will convert & store it to DB
3. A __Test ID__ will be generated so subject can pause & resume the test (ex: go out for
fresh air & junk food then come back

## Topology (pretty simple :3)
