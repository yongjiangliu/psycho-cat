## Pros & Cons

### Pros
1. Fast editing/uploading questions by EXCEL + CSV
2. User could interrupt & resume a test (ex: go for launch then come back)
3. User couldn't change answered questions
4. User could use keyboard to speed up the process
5. Multi language support

### Cons
1. Need your help to test it & report bugs
2. Lacking of support to image based questions

## How to use

Install XAMPP and make the table structure by `/doc/sql`

## History

During my job interview at BOCO, Beijing, I have to take a psychological test by pen,
which is pretty annoying. So I made the prototype of PsychoCat to speed up this process.
I'm not sure if my HR will use this in future, so I upload it to GitHub.
